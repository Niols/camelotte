## Contributing

The CI checks periodically that everything builds via Nix or via the OPAM
packaging. You may also choose either of these environments to contribute to
this repository:

- The Nix way: the flake provides a devShell for all your needs: `nix develop`,
  or `echo 'use flake' > .envrc`.

- The OPAM way: `opam install . --deps-only --with-test --with-doc`.

The Nix environment contains Git hooks that will check formatting of OCaml with
Topiary, for instance, or that `dune-project` and the `*.opam` files are in
sync. This is also enforced by the CI. There is currently no good way to follow
this the OPAM way.

## Importing

Say you have a project `<proj>` that lives in its own repository `<repo>` and
that should come to live in Camelotte under `<dir>/`:

- Rewrite its history to have it live in a subdirectory instead:
  ```
  git clone <repo> <proj>
  cd <proj>
  git filter-repo --to-subdirectory-filter <dir>/
  ```
  Note: `git filter-repo` can crash monumentally on some Git configurations;
  you might want to `mv ~/.config/git/config{,.bak}` during the rewrite.

- Import the rewritten repository into Camelotte:
  ```
  cd camelotte
  git remote add import /path/to/<proj>
  git fetch import
  git merge --allow-unrelated-histories import/main
  ## => use “Import history from `<proj>`” as commit message
  git remote remove import
  ```

- Then comes the work of integrating the project with the monorepo, adding it to
  this README, to `dune-project` and `flake.nix`, importing or cleaning up
  information from its `.gitignore`, `.github`, etc. and potentially renaming
  its tags and recreating its releases.
