## Contributing

The CI checks periodically that everything builds via Nix or via the OPAM
packaging. You may also choose either of these environments to contribute to
this repository:

- The Nix way: the flake provides a devShell for all your needs: `nix develop`,
  or `echo 'use flake' > .envrc`.

- The OPAM way: `opam install . --deps-only --with-test --with-doc`.

The Nix environment contains Git hooks that will check formatting of OCaml with
Topiary, for instance, or that `dune-project` and the `*.opam` files are in
sync. This is also enforced by the CI. There is currently no good way to follow
this the OPAM way.
